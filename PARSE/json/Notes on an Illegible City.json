    "description": "<p>Forget your Occulus Rift headset. All you need is a smartphone and an open mind to share in Southampton's virtual reality. Start at the beginning of the end, and let yourself be taken from the Western Esplanade retail development, back through Simnel Street's sordid past, all the way to the humble origins of a 12th-century marble font. What would happen if a silent object could speak? Now you can find out. Take a stroll past Bargate in two different time periods, witness an underground evolution, and pay your respects to a Norse twin-tailed mermaid at the centre of the edge. In 'Notes on an Illegible City' the past, present and future of Southampton is woven together in an eclectic tapestry. You get to decide how threadbare it has become. </p><p>Story &copy; 2016 Eloise Phillips, All Rights Reserved.<br/><br/>Editors Charlie Hargood and Verity Hunt<br/><br/>Images of Power Station, Bargate, Undercroft, High Street, and High Street Cellar courtesy of Southampton City Council Arts and Heritage.

In 1888 The Southampton Electric Light and Power Company was erected where the retail extravaganza now stands. However the very power source for the city was also a source of agony with dismal powdery air shrouding the promise that development brings. Instead it became 'notorious for irritating the eyes of Sotonians' . Southampton's own Valley of Ashes. Still, the wars brought with it an increased demand for this eyesore which quadrupled in size within these years. Whilst the Sotonian's relationship with the 'dark brooding blot'  ebbed and flowed, the 1970s saw its reduction to scrap metal. A meagre vestige of the once structurally immanent piece of Southampton. With failed hopes for the construction of Southampton Football Club the Esplanade is now a retail complex awaiting further construction.",

The peppermint creams, sour sugar of the flying saucers and chewy toffees would tantalise my tastebuds. I loved the idea of descending into its cellar to take cover from the persistent air-raids. It was as if I was returning to my childhood and that was the safest haven of all from the atrocities that accompany war. Yet the cellar did not store all of the varieties of chewy, soft, hard, oozing and fluffy delights that I had imagined and that had coloured my childhood. The cellar became a place that bled with our nightmaresâ¦ The air-raids had become routine by this point. But never did the bombs sound that loud or feel so real that night. With no exits we were blind worms wriggling pathetically beneath ground; we were already playing a role in death's performance. A water main burst in the war-torn purgatory above us, whilst we were already in hell. The cellar slowly filled with water, and there was nothing we could do but let the water fill our lungs as the awareness of our mortality filled our hearts. What a microcosmic Titanic mockery. But of all the dead in these twinned tragedies who remembers us?<br/><br/>",

This Norse twin-tailed mermaid, a symbol of globalisation as cargo ships abundant with granules of coffee from Panama arrive daily. A modern day T.J. Eckleburg. A watchful vigil with her self-approving smile. Starbucks sees more life than St Michael's church, Holyrood and Simnel Street. The coffee congregation gather like clockwork to pay homage to the siren herself. She epitomises the nowhere-ness and everywhere-ness of this port town. A simulacra of the once celebrated global industry that perseveres here. Is Starbucks the main attraction of the Royal Pier once teeming with tourists and the first step on English terrain for celebrities passing through? Now its raison-d'etre is as elusive as its underground gold trade from Johannesburg before it surfaces for some other place at some other time. Everything that passes through is muffled by the earth which buries it. A subterranean history. Raised like Morlocks, pallid and reclusive. Born in the vaults it continues to mature, never to pass the connoisseurs lips, unspoken, unknown. Southampton is at the margin of our consciousness, yet with 29,000 ft. of quay space, 7 million packages of fruit from South Africa handled, and 46% of all UK's ocean-going passenger traffic, it was, in the 1900s, at the hub of our livelihoods: does it still deserve its title of the Gateway to the World? What is a future which refuses to recognise its past?",
