    "description": "<p>England is an old place, and the raising of cities such as Bournemouth have been a blink of the eye to the great island.</p> <p>The land now crawls with light and mortar, snaking, writhing over the ground and burying what lay beneath.</p> <p>There are secrets in-between this new noise that has emerged in the recent centuries. Through the smog and behind the hum, is proof that the world was once free of human feet.</p> <p>If a seeker were so compelled, they might learn of things in this world that once were, or things that have stepped aside for the procession of civilisation.</p> <p>There was once a time when the world was not owned. To see it, you need only look for it.<br /> <br /> </p><p>Story &copy; 2016 Laurence Russell, All Rights Reserved.<br/><br/>Editors Charlie Hargood and Verity Hunt<br/></p>",
