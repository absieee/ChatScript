He was at Aswan with Field Marshall the Lord Grenfell when it was excavated. I can get you his telephone number if you&rsquo;d like.&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;That would be very helpful,&rdquo; says Andrew, holding back another cough. He reaches into his pocket, taking out some cotton gloves, his notebook and a tattered photograph of a second Egyptian model.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><img data-media-id='9'/></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The man with the cigar leans over Andrew&rsquo;s shoulder as he places the photograph on the table. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a picture of one of our British Museum models,&rdquo; Andrew replies, wafting at the cigar smoke with his hand. &ldquo;I want to compare the two.&rdquo;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&ldquo;Sensible enough; I&rsquo;ll go and find that telephone number,&rdquo; says the man, leaving the room.</p>",
